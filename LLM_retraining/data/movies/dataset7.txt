In 1934 Paris, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant. Afterward her failed audition, Victoria reluctantly returns to her apartment to find herself deciding whether or not to spend her rent money for food. That night, when Richard, Toddy's lover, comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome, Toddy incites a brawl. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria in a restaurant. She invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying, but it escapes and mayhem ensues.
The duo run through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning, Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she kicks him out. Seeing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man and presenting her to Andre Cassell, the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.
Cassell accepts her as Count Victor Grazinski, a gay Polish female impersonator and Toddy's new boyfriend. Cassell gets her a booking in a nightclub show and invites a collection of club owners to the opening. Among the guests is King Marchand, a shady owner of nightclubs in Chicago, and his ditzy moll Norma Cassidy and burly bodyguard Bernstein, a.k.a. Squash. Victor is an immediate hit, and King is smitten, but he is shocked when she is "revealed" to be a man at the end of the act. King, however, is convinced that "Victor" is not a man.
After a quarrel with Norma, King sends her back to America. Determined to get the truth, King sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's suite and confirms his suspicion when he spies her getting into the bath. He invites Victoria, Toddy, and Cassell to Chez Lui. Another fight breaks out. Squash and Toddy are arrested, along with many of the club clientele, but King and Victoria escape. King kisses Victoria, pretending that he does not care about Victoria's gender, leading them to get together.
Squash returns to the suite and catches King in bed with Victoria. King tries to explain, but then Squash reveals he himself is gay. Meanwhile, Labisse hires a P.I., Charles Bovin, to investigate Victor. Victoria and King live together for a while, but keeping up her deception strains the relationship to the breaking point, and King ends it. Back in Chicago, Norma tells King's partner Sal Andretti that King is having an affair with a man.
At the same time that Victoria has decided to give up the persona of Victor in order to be with King, Sal arrives and demands that King transfer his share of the empire to Sal for a fraction of its worth. Squash tells Victoria what is happening, and she shows Norma that she is really a woman, saving King's stake. That night at the club, Cassell tells Toddy and Victoria that Labisse has lodged a complaint against him and "Victor" for perpetrating a fraud. The inspector tells Labisse that the performer is a man and Labisse is an idiot.
In the end, Victoria joins King in the club as her real self. The announcer says that Victor is going to perform, but instead of Victoria, Toddy masquerades as "Victor". After an intentionally disastrous, but hilarious performance, Toddy claims that this is his last performance.

Heinrich swears vengeance against them. Upon returning to America, their boss, Collins (Angela Bassett) assigns them to desk duty for their protection.
FDR is a womanizer, whose cover is a cruise ship captain, while Tuck, who presents himself as a travel agent, has an ex-wife, Katie (Abigail Spencer) and a young son, Joe (John Paul Ruttan), who believes his dad is a weakling.

Her best friend, Trish (Chelsea Handler) enrolled her in the same online dating website. FDR insists on being Tuck's backup for the date and hides nearby, but Tuck and Lauren hit it off right away.
Shortly thereafter, FDR runs into Lauren at a video store and tries to flirt with her, not knowing she's Tuck's date. She surmises that he's a ladies' man and ignores him. Intrigued, FDR crashes into one of Lauren's test groups and coerces her to go on a date with him.
FDR and Tuck soon discover that they are seeing the same woman and decide not to tell her that they know each other, not to interfere with each other's dates and not to have sex with her, letting her instead come to a decision between them.

By this time both men have bugged Lauren's home and cell phone so they can spy on her when she is on dates with the other one, they overhear her tell Trish that she is going to need to have sex with them both to decide which one is the right one.

They engage in an extended fight, after which Lauren discovers that they are in fact best friends and, feeling made a fool of, leaves with Trish. At that moment, the women are kidnapped by Heinrich and his men, who are pursued by FDR and Tuck.

Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is a depressed and unmotivated thirty-year-old woman living in a small town in Texas with her husband Phil (John C. Reilly), a house painter who spends most of his free time smoking marijuana with his best friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson). Justine works at Retail Rodeo, the local big-box store, along with Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel), a cynical, plain-spoken young woman, Gwen (Deborah Rush), a ditzy older woman who manages the cosmetics counter, and Corny (Mike White), a Nazarene security guard.
One morning, Justine notices a new cashier and later introduces herself. Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears quiet and reserved, qualities that the two of them share and, therefore, quickly take a liking to one another. They begin taking their lunch breaks together and Justine gives Holden rides home. One time, he invites her in and she accepts. They swap stories about their lives including how Justine feels unappreciated by Phil and Holden tells her of his obsession with J. D. Salinger's novel, The Catcher in the Rye, and how he took his self-assigned first name from its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.
As the weeks go by, Justine and Holden start to bring out the best in each other. But when Holden makes a pass at her, she rejects him, leaving him dismayed. He becomes more and more besotted by her. Some time later, Holden does not show up to work but sends a letter to Justine, writing that if she does not meet him at 5pm that day behind the nearest Chuck E. Cheese, she will never see him again. After much consideration, Justine decides to accept Holden's invitation, only to be intercepted by her manager, Jack (John Carroll Lynch), who insists that she take a very ill Gwen to the hospital. Justine then meets up with Holden. The two have sex for the first time in a motel room that Justine pays for with her credit card.
As the affair continues, Justine's marriage to Phil continues to deteriorate. One night, Justine spots Bubba's truck in the parking lot of the motel where she's been meeting Holden. She becomes convinced that Bubba knows, telling Holden that they need to cool down for a while. When Justine goes to visit Gwen in the hospital, she is told that Gwen has died after contracting parasites from eating poisonous blackberries that she bought at a roadside fruit stand. When she returns home, Bubba starts hinting to Justine that he knows about her affair with Holden. Feeling guilty, Justine suggests that she and Phil should attend a church bible study that Corny, a security guard, had invited them to. Soon after they arrive, Justine spots the motel desk clerk she encountered with Holden, she grabs Phil and demand they leave immediately.
Justine speaks to Holden in private at work the following day, explaining that what they're doing is wrong and she can't see him anymore. Bubba tells Justine to meet him at his house. He blackmails her into having sex with him by threatening to tell Phil about her affair if she refuses, and she reluctantly gives into his demands. Holden, who has been following her since the split, sees them through a window.
Holden does not show up for work the next day but is waiting in Justine's car when her shift ends. He calls Justine a whore and drunkenly demands an apology. He then says he could kill her husband to free her from her marriage. Justine becomes desperate to extricate herself from the relationship with Holden. She goes to talk to his parents and tells them that he is mentally ill and that he has imagined a romantic liaison between them. She goes on to suggest that Holden be hospitalized. That night after feeling unwell all day, Justine takes a pregnancy test. The results are positive. Phil is over the moon, but Justine feels uneasy, since she doesn't know whether the father is Holden or Phil.
The next day when Justine arrives at work, Cheryl tells her that someone stole $15,000 from the safe and that the police suspect Holden. Justine is called into Jack's office and interrogated about their relationship. As she leaves for lunch, Justine encounters Holden, who brags about having stolen the money and about his plans for them to escape. Holden tells her to meet her the following morning at a hotel. When Justine gets home, Phil, Bubba, and Bubba's new girlfriend are all waiting for her so they can celebrate. The phone rings and Phil answers. The doctor's office has called; they tell Phil his sperm is "no good". He tells them his wife is pregnant and they don't know what they are talking about and angrily hangs up. Bubba assures Phil they made a mistake, that "they don't know everything". Phil then questions aloud if this means Justine isn't pregnant. She also assures Phil that they just made a mistake.
The next morning Justine quickly packs a suitcase. While waiting at the light to turn toward either the hotel or the Retail Rodeo store, she assess her future if she stays versus if she runs away and becomes a fugitive with Holden. She decides to stay. She arrives at Retail Rodeo and goes to the manager's office, telling him where Holden is hiding and how long he will be there. After arriving home, she watches a news report saying that the police have surrounded the hotel where Holden is staying and that Holden shot and killed himself. The next day, Bubba shows up at Retail Rodeo and tells Justine that Phil opened a statement from the credit card company, which listed the motel that Justine paid for with the card. Bubba then begs Justine not to tell Phil about their sexual encounter. When Justine arrives home, Phil is looking at the credit card statement and tearfully asks Justine if she has been having an affair. After she says, "yes", Phil strikes her. Later, Phil expresses remorse at hitting his wife and asked her if the baby is his. Wanting to spare Phil any more pain and protect herself, she tells him that he is the father. Phil insists on knowing who she had an affair with. When Justine says it doesn't matter, Phil concludes it's Corny, the security guard who invited them to Bible study. When Justine arrives at work the next morning, Cheryl attempts to cover up her facial bruises with make-up just as Corny walks by. His arm is in a cast and his face beat up. Cheryl informs Justine two "beefy guys" with baseball bats and face masks beat him up.
As the movie concludes, Justine is still employed at Retail Rodeo. In a narrated scene, Phil brings the baby to Justine, who is deep in thought on the bed. She lovingly holds the baby and the couple seems blissful.

The Road Runner, known as Boulevardius Burnupius, giving Wile E. a "come-on" to chase him, and the camera moves to Wile and freezes to show he is Dogius Ignoramii for this cartoon. The chase continues until the coyote stops to read a sign, but the Road Runner pulls up behind him and beeps the coyote into another headache.
Not deterred by this one bit, the coyote continues his dastardly plans: he leaves the Road Runner a free snack on the edge of a cliff while he sneaks up behind his enemy and tries to eat him. However, sensing the danger, the Road Runner extends his neck all the way around the screen and beeps in the back of the coyote.
In a similar scheme to one used in the previous cartoon, Wile now locks and loads an ACME Giant Mouse Trap and leaves it in the road for the Road Runner to trip.
Despite his failures with it, the coyote loads himself into a spring attached to a rock and lets go as the Road Runner passes. The Voices of Spring Waltz plays on the music track as Wile E. ends up being carried across the plateau. Wile E. eventually moves into thin air, and soon catches on to the situation, gulps, and falls. The coyote leaves this with his neck also coiled up like a Slinky.
With these newer cartoons come more ludicrous products, such as ACME Instant Road, which Wile E. rolls out across an arch and down the straight slope in an effort to get the Road Runner to follow him, until he runs out of road and he is left staring at the ground. Before he falls he holds up a sign saying "In heaven's name, what am I doing?" and when he falls he holds another one saying "BYE!"
The coyote attempts to launch himself with a bow to chase the Road Runner, but the bow simply freezes without firing. He hangs in midair for a couple seconds before he realizes this, and attempts to fix it by twanging the bowstring. He enjoys the sound it produces and proceeds to play a rendition of Those Endearing Young Charms, until it activates and launches Wile E. into a cactus.
The Cactus Costume has arrived, and Wile puts it on and hops out into the road while the Road Runner is passing him. However, he fails to grab the Road Runner and wraps his arms around himself, causing massive pain due to the spines. After Catty Wile E. escapes from the costume, he kicks the box into the desert.
As the Road Runner pulls up to another outcropping and signals to the coyote, Wile attempts to see-saw his way over to his rival with a rock and board. However, when the rock lands on the other side, it causes the board to smash into the coyote, and the rock then lands on the thin edge of the board, resulting in it wedging the edge of the outcropping away. This falls to the earth, with Wile, the board, the rock, and two smaller rocks located next to the see-saw following it. As the board looms over the coyote, Wile heaves it into the air before a rock hits the ground, then the outcropping edge, followed by the coyote on the right and the other rock on the left. This causes the coyote to be thrown upwards and bump his head directly on the falling board before he drops on the right side of the outcropping edge and jumps the second rock onto himself, as the board wedges just to the right.
Another rather ludicrous ACME product: ACME Lightning Bolts takes up the remainder of the cartoon. With the safety gloves, the coyote grabs a lightning bolt and successfully sizzles a practice saguaro. He throws a second one at the Road Runner, who stops and takes stock of the situation, and turns the other way as the electricity chases him. The bolt and bird chase all over the mountains until they enter a tunnel. When they come out, the lightning somehow has overtaken the Road Runner, who beeps at the lightning to get it to reverse. The hapless coyote hurts himself repeatedly with white-hot lightning in his back, across the landscape and even off into the sunset.

Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his new bride, Jane (Rachael Taylor), leave New York City for Tokyo, Japan, where Ben has a job as a photographer. While travelling by car in the wilderness of the countryside, Jane accidentally hits a girl standing in the middle of the road and ends up running over her. They could not find a body or even a trace of blood and decide to leave, thinking the victim was all right and had left. They later start to find mysterious lights in their photos, which are later identified as spirit photography by Ben's assistant, Seiko Nakamura (Maya Hazen). Jane begins to have eerie dreams and visions as if they are trying to tell her something and senses a haunting presence stalking them. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and hunched over, although the doctor could not determine what was the actual physical cause of it. Seiko takes Jane to her ex-boyfriend, Ritsuo (James Kyson Lee), whose career is to investigate paranormal activities, and he tells them that the lights in the photos are spirits as well as manifestations of intense emotions that are trying to be communicated. At a subway station, Jane spots the ghostly presence of the girl she hit and ran over, causing her to believe that she killed the girl. Later, Ben also has a similarly-terrifying encounter. They go to a medium, Murase, to find out what spiritual activity is really happening to them. However, after Murase clearly appears to have stumbled upon something, Ben refuses to translate what Murase says and storms out, claiming that he is a fraud.
Jane decides to visit the office building in one of the photos. She takes pictures and encounters the yūrei, and learns that the girl's name was Megumi Tanaka and that Ben knew her. When she confronts Ben about it, he admits that he and Megumi were once involved in a relationship, but that after the death of her father, she became very obsessive and clingy, and eventually he walked out on her, with help from his two friends.
Ben's friends, Adam (John Hensley) and Bruno (David Denman), are killed by Megumi. After witnessing Bruno's death, Ben wants to leave but Jane hands Ben their wedding photo, which shows a distorted picture of Megumi. They realize she's been with them the entire time and go to Megumi's home, only to find her decayed body. She had committed suicide with potassium cyanide long before the car impact and thus they had actually first encountered her as a ghost at that time.
That night, Ben is tortured by Megumi. Jane screams at Megumi to leave them alone; Megumi stops with a brief sinister laugh, leaving Ben alive. After Megumi's funeral, Ben and Jane return to New York, thinking it's all over. However, Jane finds some recent photos in an envelope which show Megumi. With Megumi's clues, Jane finds a camera in a trunk and uploads the memory card into the laptop. There, Jane sees photos taken by Ben, showing Adam and Bruno raping Megumi before her suicide, while Ben does nothing but watch them doing the deed.
Ben returns home, where he tries to explain to a distraught Jane that he felt it was the only way to drive Megumi away. They had planned on using the pictures as blackmail against Megumi if she didn't leave him alone but it turned into rape. This explains why Megumi murdered Adam and Bruno, as Ben knew this was about revenge against all three of them. Believing that Megumi was trying to warn her, and disgusted by Ben's past actions, Jane concludes that she can't spend her life with someone like Ben so she leaves him. Ben tries to stop her, but Megumi locks the door and doesn't let him.
Driven mad by Megumi, Ben throws the camera across the room. It takes a picture of him, showing Megumi sitting astride his shoulders. Remembering his shoulder pains and the hospital where a nurse weighed Ben and it showed the weight of two people, Ben realizes that Megumi has been with him all along since her suicide without his knowledge. Horrified, and in a desperate attempt to rid himself of her, he electrocutes himself. He is rendered catatonic and sent to a mental institution, where he is shown sitting slumped over on the edge of his bed. The last scene shows Megumi still draped over his back.

At a school dance, Petey's shy roommate has worked up the nerve to invite campus beauty Mirabel Allstairs to be his date. The increasingly arrogant Petey ignores his own date, Martha Scroggs, dancing with other girls instead.
Petey pulls pranks on campus, going so far as to change a professor's clocks to delay an exam. A later act of vandalism leads to yet another arrest. This time the judge threatens to throw the book at Petey, sentencing him to six months in jail. Petey asks for a week's continuance before sentencing, then uses the time to court Martha, having discovered her to be the daughter of the judge.
Once his scheme is revealed, Petey is locked in the town jail by the angry judge. Martha is smitten with him now, however, throws a rock to get arrested so she can end up in the next cell, holding hands with Petey between the bars.
Back in the present, the old judge still can't believe how his daughter and son-in-law ended up together. They also hear that Petey Jr. has just been placed under arrest, which doesn't surprise the judge a bit.
Talent agent and huckster Sammy Kamin (Billy Crystal) travels to Romania on business after splitting up with his wife. After his young client fires him, Sammy crashes his car and is rescued while unconscious by an enormous Romanian man named Max (Gheorghe Mureșan) who is close to 8 feet tall.
Sammy thinks the rescuer is God, as he can only see Max's giant hands. When Sammy wakes up, he thinks he is in Heaven. But he is confused to find a statue of Jesus next to his bed, as he was raised Jewish. He then realizes Max has brought him to a monastery, where he was raised after being given up for adoption by his parents because of his height.
Once he wakes up and interacts with Max, he sees potential stardom in him. Sammy attempts to broker his introduction into the movies. In doing so he exploits Max' desire to visit a long-lost paramour, Lilliana (Joanna Pacuła), in Gallup, New Mexico. First, Max obtains the role of a villain in a movie, but he is so drunk that he vomits on the protagonist (Sammy's former client). However, the scene is included in the movie.
One day, Sammy talks to Steven Seagal about including Max as a villain in one of his movies, convincing him that he needs a different kind of villain. At first Seagal rejects him because there was another actor who would take that role, but he changes his opinion after listening to an extract of a Shakespearean play done by Max.
Suddenly, after some medical exams, Max is diagnosed with heart disease which cannot be treated with a transplant because his heart is so big. Sammy decides to find Lilliana, and tries to convince her to meet Max again, but she rejects the invitation. Sammy then convinces his wife to take the role of Lilliana and after some words, Max asks her for a kiss.
Afterwards, Sammy and his wife decide to get back together again, after realizing that they were truly in love and that their son needed them.
Sammy eventually decides to return Max home to Romania. Max refuses to go back, but finally he enters his old house, and meet his parents again. Sammy ends up watching Max's first filmed scene in a cinema with his family. Max dies shortly after, because of his heart, but he changed many people's lives forever.
Clay Halliday meets up with his estranged brother Daniel to tell him that their father, Big Dan, is dying and that Clay is engaged to Aleta Burris. Daniel is surprised to hear that their father would give his blessing to the engagement. When they return to the ranch, there are obvious sparks between Daniel and Aleta.
Before he enters his father's room, Daniel has a flashback remembering the time before they became estranged. His father is a lawman. He finds out that his daughter, Martha, is in love with Jivaro Burris (Aleta's brother), a half-breed who works on the Halliday ranch. Big Dan orders Jivaro off the ranch. When a rider is attacked and killed, Jivaro is also attacked as he happened to be riding in the vicinity. Big Dan arrests Jivaro and puts him in jail.
Big Dan leaves with a posse to hunt down the rest of the suspected attackers despite a plea from Daniel to, leaving his son Clay as the only deputy to guard Jivaro despite an angry mob outside the jail. Daniel and Clay try to help Jivaro escape but the mob enters and he is lynched.
Daniel leaves the ranch vowing never to return and goes to Aleta's home to say goodbye. Her father, Chad Burris, overhears Daniel and Aleta saying that they should not tell him about Big Dan's role in the lynching. Big Dan and Clay go to the Burris ranch. A face-off between Big Dan and Mr. Burris occurs with Big Dan killing Burris.
After the funeral for both Burris men, Daniel again leaves. Martha brings Aleta to the Halliday ranch to recover from an illness following the burials. Clay begins to fall in love with Aleta.
Several unusual events happen to the Halliday ranch, all caused by Daniel, including a stampede of Halliday's cattle. Big Dan forms a posse to hunt for Daniel, who he knows is behind the stampede. Big Dan finds a noose hanging inside his house, sets fire to a barn, and writes a threatening note about getting rid of Big Dan as a lawman. Daniel who is hiding in the shadows when the barn burns meets up with Aleta and they embrace for the first time. Aleta tells him that Daniel is becoming like his father.
The townsfolk ask Big Dan to hand in his badge, but he refuses. Daniel confronts his father and they brawl with Daniel coming out on top.
We learn that six months have passed. Daniel flashes forward and enters Big Dan's room where he tells him he is glad that things have changed-that he has given approval for Clay to marry Aleta (a half-breed). Big Dan tells him he lied to get him to come back and draws a gun on Daniel threatening to kill him. Martha comes in and takes away the gun. Daniel, Martha, Clay, and Aleta all leave the room in disgust. Big Dan crawls out of bed to get his gun and staggers out to shoot Daniel. Daniel stands up to him and challenges him to shoot him. Big Dan relents and does not shoot saying that Daniel is too much like him. He dies in Daniel's arms.
The film takes place in the New Mexico territory of the United States in the 1860s. Bill Cody and his friend Gabby Whitaker arrive in the New Mexico territory sometime in the 1860s, Gabby feels the land is worthless as it is filled with nothing but “Injins and rocks”. Bill begins discussing Buffalo until he notices a woman driving a seemingly out of control carriage. Bill and Gabby stop the horses, but the woman berates them saying she didn’t any help.
In town Bill and Gabby are talking about the previous events, when the woman overhears their conversation and introduces herself as Tonia Regas. Tonia asks both men what they are doing in Santa Fe and Bill says they were called to do a land survey by U.S Colonel, Joseph Calhoun. Upon hearing this Tonia leaves.
At Colonel Calhoun’s homestead, Gabby introduces the Colonel to Bill. Calhoun reveals he knows Bill through his excellent reputation with the Pony Express and as a Buffalo hunter. Calhoun tells the men that his men have been having trouble with a medicine man named Akuna. Gabby and Bill agree to help.
Meanwhile Tonia arrives at her home where her grandfather, Don Regas tells her she must never go into town alone again. Don Regas then expresses his disdain with the survey by the American government to his friend Emelio Montez. Later, Montez sends a message to his half-brother, Akuna and Akuna’s men ride out with rifles. Akuna and his men meet with Montez. Akuna reveals they were born from the same mother, but Montez’s father was a white man. Montez asks for the location of a gold mine the Regas’ land. Akuna laments, saying the location is only for the chief, referring to himself, to know. Montez says he will find a way to acquire the land from Regas and claim the land for their tribe.
Later Colonel Calhoun’s son Jerry arrives in Santa Fe. Colonel Calhoun introduces Jerry to Bill and Gabby, and then tells Jerry that although a more experienced is needed, he took a chance to help his son.
Jerry accompanies, the surveyors out to part of the Regas land where they are attacked by Akuna’s men, but they it out alive with only one men being injured. Back in town Jerry and Don Regas discuss the land agreement. Bill tells Tonia that the survey is only a formality and when the survey is all over the ranch will still belong to her family. Tonia and Bill help Jerry convince Don Regas to allow the survey and he complies. Jerry spends his nights at a cantina gambling away his money. Bill expresses his concern with Jerry’s habit, but Jerry rebuffs him. Jerry soon finds himself $4,000 in debt to the cantina. Montez takes advantages of Jerry’s misfortune and offers to erase the debt if Jerry uses to survey to make sure the northern part of the Regas land is not part of the survey. Jerry forges the survey, saying the northern territory does not belong to Don Regas and it is free land.
Bill and Gabby arrive at the Regas house to inform them that the survey has been completed. He is not there, but Tonia offers to take Bill inside to discuss business. Bill tells Tonia the news as Don Regas walks in, both are angry and accuse Bill and the American government of trying to cheat them. An outraged Don Regas announces he will take his matter to Washington and makes preparations to leave in the morning. Tonia is distraught with Bill and says she never wants to see him again. Later Jerry meets with Montez. Jerry knows that his survey won’t hold up if investigated by Washington. Montez reveals his plan to kill Don Regas. Jerry wants no part in this and attempts to inform his father, but Montez subdues him before he can leave and later has Akuna hold him hostage. Montez has Akuna hide Jerry’s body and asks his half-brother to kill Don Regas. Bill and Gabby soon find out about the Montez’s plan and rush off to stop it. Akuna and his men attack Don Regas and his caravan. Killing his drivers and gunners, the carriage overturns and Regas is shot trying to defend himself. Bill and Gabby try to shoot Akuna, but they are out of range.
Bill and Gabby take Don Regas back to town for him to recuperate. Akuna goes to Montez to deliver the news, but when Montez asks for the dead Akuna reveals he did not have time to search for it. They return to the wreckage only to find that Don Regas’ body has been moved. Montez sets off to get to the bottom of the situation. Back at the Regas house, Tonia confronts Bill about the attack on her grandfather. They are interrupted by Montez who tries to kill them. Montez flees while Bill and Gabby give chase. Montez, thinking he has lost them, leads Bill and Gabby directly to Akuna’s hideout. Bill and Gabby make their way past two guards and into the room where Jerry is being held.

André-Louis Moreau (Ramon Novarro) loves Aline de Kercadiou (Alice Terry), the niece of his godfather, Quintin de Kercadiou (Lloyd Ingraham), and she him. However Quintin would prefer she married the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr (Lewis Stone), a middle-aged nobleman, rather than someone who does not even know who his parents are.
One day, expert swordsman de la Tour first toys with, then kills André's friend Philippe de Vilmorin in a duel. André turns to the King's Lieutenant for justice. However, when the official learns who the accused is, he immediately orders André's arrest. André flees.
Meanwhile, France nears the brink of revolution. When one orator in favor of liberty and equality is shot down by a soldier, André fearlessly takes his place and remains undaunted when he is grazed by a bullet. When the dragoons are called out to disperse the mob, an admirer named Chapelier helps André escape.
He joins a wandering theatre troupe led by Challefau Binet (James A. Marcus). André writes better plays for them to perform, and they become very successful, eventually performing at a theatre in Paris. André becomes engaged to Binet's daughter, Climène (Edith Allen).
Aline and de la Tour attend a performance of his latest work, however, and she and André spot each other. She goes to see him, but he does not wish to renew their relationship. De la Tour, despite loving Aline, cannot help trifling with Climène. By chance, Aline and Countess de Plougastel (Julia Swayne Gordon), with whom she is staying, see him in a carriage with Climène. Aline informs de la Tour she never wants to see him again. De la Tour blackmails the countess into helping him, reminding her of an incident in her past.
Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, the aristocrats, unable to effectively respond to the reform-minded delegates with words, resort to duels to eliminate their leading opponents. Chief among the duelists is de la Tour. In desperation, Danton and Chapelier recruit André to reply in kind. The Chevalier de Chabrillone (William Humphrey) is his first victim. Eventually, he gets what he wants: a duel with de la Tour. He disarms his foe, then allows him to pick up his sword. After André wounds the nobleman in his sword arm, de la Tour gives up.
When news reaches Paris that the Austrians and Prussians have invaded France in support of the beleaguered King Louis XVI, the French Revolution erupts. In the fighting, de la Tour is overwhelmed and left for dead. When he revives, he staggers to the residence of the countess. André heads there too, to rescue his love and his mother the countess (whose identity has been revealed to him by de Kercadiou), armed with a passport signed by Danton authorizing him to do anything he wants. When the two bitter enemies spot each other, de la Tour demands the passport. André refuses, whereupon de la Tour draws a pistol. The countess throws herself in front of de la Tour, then reveals that he is in fact André's father. The two men have an initially uneasy reconciliation. When de la Tour starts to leave, André offers him his sword. Thus armed, de la Tour faces the rioters in the street and perishes.
André places the two women in a covered carriage. At the Paris gate, a man spots the aristocrats inside and demands they be handed over to the mob. Moreau pleads with them to let them go for his sake. The masses respond with extravagant sentimentality, and the trio are allowed to leave Paris.
In the then-future year of 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult amusement park called Delos features three themed "worlds"—Westworld (the American Old West), Medievalworld (medieval Europe), and Romanworld (the ancient Roman city of Pompeii). The resort's three "worlds" are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises, "Boy, have we got a vacation for you!"
Peter Martin (Benjamin), a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane (Brolin), on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger (Brynner), a robot programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel.
The technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the robots in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the "analogy of an infectious disease," he is told by the chief supervisor (Alan Oppenheimer), "We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been designed by other computers. We don't know exactly how they work."
The malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld, and, against its programming, an android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's Black Knight robot kills a guest in a swordfight. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. However, the shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. Meanwhile, the robots in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.
Martin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's bordello, unaware of the park's massive breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement until the robot outdraws and shoots, killing him. Martin runs for his life and the robot implacably follows.
Martin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only dead guests, damaged robots, and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos who is shortly thereafter shot by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors so he runs away until he enters a robot-repair lab. When the Gunslinger comes into the room, Martin pretends to be a robot, throws acid into its face, and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.
With its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track him visually and tries to find Martin using its infrared scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the robot, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. Martin sits on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the irony of Delos's slogan resonates: "Boy, have we got a vacation for you!"
Paddington, having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, has become popular in his community, offering people emotional support in various ways. To purchase a unique pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen. Paddington chases the thief, who escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. Although Mr. Gruber and the Browns do not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the thief even existed, Paddington is wrongfully convicted and jailed. The thief soon returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who lives opposite the Browns.
Whilst in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who hires Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan begins using the pop-up book to locate a series of clues within London's famous landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure, wearing a different disguise for each visit. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the stolen book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author. They start investigating the landmarks on the popup book and discover a suspicious character (Buchanan) has been visiting each one as well.
With Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence but keep hunting. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, as well as the book itself, discovering that each of the suspicious characters visiting the landmarks were Buchanan. Before they can act further, Buchanan returns home and suspects something is wrong. Meanwhile, the Browns reveal what they have discovered to the police, only to be informed that they need stronger evidence, such as the book with his fingerprints on it, to prove that he is guilty. They miss a prison visit with Paddington, causing Paddington to believe that the Browns have forgotten all about him.
Paddington soon takes part in a prison break alongside several other inmates, including Knuckles, who promises to aid in proving his innocence but promptly abandons the idea in order to leave the country as a free man, inviting Paddington to come with him. Paddington refuses and, whilst roaming the streets and avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave shortly.
Paddington reaches the station and makes it onto the train just as it leaves - the Browns begin their pursuit on another steam train at the opposite platform. When caught up, Henry Brown and Mrs. Bird board the other train and confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and makes good his initial escape. Paddington is left trapped in the train's rear carriage, the coupling of which Buchanan severs and switches down a different track, leaving it to crash into a nearby river. Mary Brown tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who have a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Eventually, Henry knocks out Buchanan just as he tries to access the so-called treasure, and he is promptly taken into custody.
Paddington, now declared innocent, becomes very ill after the events, slipping into a short three-day coma yet recovering upon waking up on Aunt Lucy's birthday. With the book taken in as evidence by the police, Paddington is disappointed that he was unable to buy Lucy a present as promised, though soon discovers the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood including Mr. Curry, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.
Meanwhile, Buchanan is sentenced to 10 years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use, hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building.
In the Caribbean, late in the 18th century, Captain Vallo (Burt Lancaster), a pirate known as "The Crimson Pirate", and his crew capture a frigate of the King's navy. The ship is carrying Baron Gruda (Leslie Bradley), a special envoy of the King on his way to the island of Cobra to crush a rebellion. Vallo proposes selling the frigate's weapons cache to El Libre, the leader of Cobra's rebels. Baron Gruda counters by proposing that Vallo capture El Libre and bring him to the Baron for a sizable reward. Vallo accepts, and Baron Gruda and his crew are released, while Vallo keeps the frigate. Some of his crew complain that this is not pirate business, but they come around when they find out the large amount of profit to be made.
Vallo and his crew sail to Cobra, where the captain and his lieutenant, Ojo (Nick Cravat), go ashore and meet with the island's rebels, led by Pablo Murphy (Noel Purcell) and Consuelo (Eva Bartok). Vallo and Ojo learn that El Libre has been captured and is in prison on the island of San Pero. The meeting is interrupted by the King's guards, and Consuelo quickly leads Vallo and Ojo to safety. Returning to the frigate, Vallo informs his crew he will rescue El Libre, though Consuelo only believes Vallo is interested in selling weapons to him. While promising Vallo that he will receive his payment, she informs him that El Libre is actually her father.
After sailing to San Pero, Vallo impersonates the Baron and goes to a dinner held in Gruda's honor by the Colonel of the island's garrison (Frank Pettingell). For the disguised Vallo, the Colonel puts on display El Libre (Frederick Leister) and another captured rebel, Professor Elihu Prudence (James Hayter). Vallo orders the prisoners released into his custody, and he leaves, returning with them to the frigate, which sets sail for Cobra.
Consuelo is grateful to Vallo for rescuing her father, but is distraught to hear that Vallo intends on selling her, El Libre, and the professor to Baron Gruda. Ojo suggests that Vallo has fallen in love with Consuelo, but he denies this after releasing all three prisoners. Consuelo now begs Vallo to come with them but he refuses. Vallo's first mate, Humble Bellows (Torin Thatcher), overhears this exchange, and turns against his captain for breaking his word, sending a message ashore to Baron Gruda.
Vallo lets El Libre and Consuelo leave, but the King's guards are waiting, and El Libre is killed and Consuelo is captured. The pirates mutiny against Vallo, and Humble Bellows is elected their new captain. Baron Gruda promises Bellows gold for dealing with Vallo. So the professor, Ojo, and Vallo are cast adrift in a skiff in the outgoing current and left to die. Gruda proposes a toast, presenting the pirates with a barrel of rum. Unknown to them, the rum has been drugged; after consuming the rum and passing out, they are captured and transferred back to Vallo's ship, now prisoners for Gruda to sell to the King.
Baron Gruda informs Consuelo that she will now marry Herman (Eliot Makeham), the governor of Cobra, or he will execute the island's population. Consuelo is compelled to accept, and Gruda announces the wedding date and mandatory attendance by everyone. In the meantime Vallo, Ojo, and the clever professor escape their dilemma by capsizing their skiff, trapping a large air pocket for them to breath; walking along the sea bottom toward Cobra, they come ashore, where they quickly find out about the wedding. Vallo intends to rescue Consuelo, but the professor convinces him to first enlist the island's cooperation. Vallo agrees, and along with the professor's advanced knowledge, the people of Cobra build his advanced weapons for their coming revolt. Nitroglycerin grenades, multiple cannon tanks, flamethrowers, rapid-fire rifles on revolving drums, and a large inflatable balloon with gondola are constructed in secret.
On the day of the wedding, the people unleash the advanced arsenal just before the ceremony, over-throwing the governor and his guards. Baron Gruda manages to escape to his frigate, taking Consuelo with him. Vallo and Ojo go after them in the large balloon. They spot their old ship below and slide down the balloon's tie-down ropes to its deck, and release the pirates. They then pursue Gruda's frigate. As the pirate ship gets close, Vallo orders the pirates below deck, making Gruda believe they are about to launch a full broadside. Instead, they sneak out through the gun ports, drop into the sea, and swim underwater to Gruda's frigate. A repentant Humble Bellows stays aboard to keep the ship on course, sacrificing himself after Gruda orders a broadside, which destroys the pirate ship. Vallo and his pirates surface, climbing aboard the frigate; the guards are defeated in the ensuing battle, while the Baron is killed. In victory Vallo and Consuelo embrace.
A story about a group of ghosts who have lost their shelter due to urbanization. The story starts with a struggling wannabe director who somehow crosses paths with a stranger. The stranger starts to narrate a story to him about a group of ghosts that stays together.

A scandalous rumor about Mi-jin (Go Won-hee), an up-and-coming actress, is included as a gossip item in a stock market tipsheet (jjirasi) and propagated by the tabloids, causing her to kill herself in an apparent suicide. Woo-gon (Kim Kang-woo), Mi-jin's devoted longtime manager who dedicated everything to building her career, initiates a vengeful investigation to expose the sources of the rumor. With unexpected assistance from tabloid distributor Mr. Park (Jung Jin-young) and legendary wiretapper Baek Moon (Ko Chang-seok), Woo unravels the opaque and lucrative world of secret tips and salacious rumors.[4][5]
The film portrays a particularly insidious and unexpected forum for tabloid gossip-mongering: jjirasi (from the Japanese word chirashi, meaning "leaflet"), or the stock market tipsheet. In weekly secret meetings consisting of corporate personnel, politicians, reporters, public officials, and others, insiders exchange information about the latest goings-on. The collected intelligence is published into a tip sheet and distributed through paid subscriber channels before getting picked up by the tabloids as juicy blind items. What makes this combination particularly toxic is the sheen of respectability and truth given by the financial market players involved, despite the only occasional accuracy of its content.[6]
In 1938, refugee Peter Vadassy (James Mason) decides to take a vacation at the Hotel Reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending French citizenship. When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin (Julien Mitchell) of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Peter is released on condition that he find out which other hotel guests have cameras like his.
Peter does some snooping and eavesdrops on a suspicious conversation between Paul Heimberger (Frederick Valk) and the hotel's proprietor, Madame Suzanne Koch (Lucie Mannheim). He searches Heimberger's room and finds several passports, all with different names and nationalities. Heimberger catches him in the act, but eventually matters are straightened out. Heimberger explains that he was originally a Social Democratic newspaper publisher who was anti-Nazi and been sent to a concentration camp for two years. After he was released, he joined an underground movement against the German regime.
Peter spots his camera in the pocket of a dressing-gown belonging to Odette Roux (Patricia Medina) and Andre (Herbert Lom), a couple on their honeymoon. Andre first tries to bribe Peter into giving him the negative and, when that fails, threatens him with a pistol. The police arrive at that moment and arrest Peter for espionage.
The Rouxs leave the hotel, but find Heimberger trying to disable the hotel's car. Andre shoots him dead and the couple speed off to Toulon, unaware that they are being tracked by the police. Beghin had known the identity of the spies all along and merely used Peter to further his true goal; to find out who the Rouxs are reporting to. The spy ring is captured. Andre gets away, but is caught on a roof by Peter. Andre slips and falls to his death.

Maïna, Innu chief Mishtenapuu's daughter, embarks on a quest into Inuit territory to rescue Nipki, a young boy from her community captured by the Inuit following a battle.[2]
Lawrence Jamieson is an intelligent and sophisticated British con artist operating in the French Riviera with the help of manservant Arthur and corrupt police official Andre. He seduces wealthy and morally suspect women and steals their money. His only concern is a con artist known as "The Jackal" who has been preying on other wealthy victims.
When underachieving American hustler Freddy Benson searches for easy marks in Beaumont-sur-Mer, Lawrence's home base, Lawrence believes the Jackal has shown his face. Worried that Freddy's inexperienced antics will scare away his prey, Lawrence has Freddy arrested and put on the next plane out of town. However, Freddy meets one of Lawrence's former marks and deduces that he is also a crook.
Returning to Beaumont-sur-Mer, Freddy forces Lawrence to take him on as a pupil in exchange for his silence. Lawrence attempts to teach Freddy about high culture with limited success. He also involves him as a subordinate player in his cons, making him play the mentally challenged and socially inept Ruprecht in order to scare away their female targets after their money has been acquired. Freddy, tired of not getting paid and the humiliating part he has to play, strikes out on his own.
Lawrence believes there are not enough potential victims in Beaumont-sur-Mer for both of them, so a bet is proposed to decide who will stay. The first to con $50,000 out of a selected mark may remain; the other must leave town. The two select Janet Colgate, a naive American heiress, and embark on their separate strategies while ruthlessly sabotaging each other. Freddy poses as a psychosomatically crippled U.S. veteran unable to walk after seeing his fiancee cheat on him with Dance U.S.A. host Deney Terrio, and who needs to borrow $50,000 for treatment by the celebrated Liechtenstein psychiatrist Dr. Emil Shaffhausen. When Lawrence discovers this scheme he claims to be Dr. Shaffhausen, insisting Freddy's condition is one he can cure, stipulating that Janet pay the $50,000 fee directly to him.
Lawrence discovers that Janet is not wealthy but on vacation as a contest winner; she intends to liquidate most of her assets to pay for Freddy's treatment. Touched by Janet's kindness, Lawrence calls off the bet. Freddy agrees, but proposes a new bet: Janet herself, with the first to bed her declared the winner. Lawrence refuses to bed Janet; instead the bet will be whether or not Freddy can succeed.
Lawrence keeps Janet from having any time alone with Freddy in which they might consummate a relationship. With the help of some British sailors, Freddy waylays Lawrence and rushes to Janet's hotel room where he demonstrates his love by walking to her. However, Janet is not alone. Lawrence is present and declares Freddy cured of his ailment. Ushering Freddy out of the room he explains that the sailors released him after discovering that he is a Royal Naval Reserve officer. The sailors, angry at being duped by Freddy, keep him occupied at a party while Lawrence puts Janet on a plane to America. Despite his impending loss, Freddy becomes inebriated and enjoys the party.
The next day, instead of boarding her flight, Janet returns to her hotel room to find a repentant Freddy there. They kiss, close the door and begin undressing. The news reaches Lawrence and he accepts his defeat with grace. While Lawrence is waiting for Freddy to return and gloat over his victory, Janet arrives in tears. She tells him that Freddy stole the money her father sent. Lawrence compensates her with $50,000 of his own, calls Andre to have Freddy arrested, and takes Janet to the airport.
At the last minute before Janet boards the plane, she gives the bag to Lawrence, saying, "I can't take this. It doesn't belong to me." As the plane leaves, the police arrive with Freddy, wearing nothing but a bathrobe, who claims that Janet robbed the both of them, including stealing Freddy's clothes. Lawrence opens up the bag to find Freddy's clothes and, underneath, a note from Janet admitting to having taken the $50,000 and revealing herself to be the Jackal. Freddy is furious while Lawrence is impressed.
The following week, Freddy and Lawrence are at Lawrence's villa contemplating their loss. They are about to part company when the Jackal, posing as a New York City real estate developer, arrives in a yacht filled with wealthy people. She promptly has the shocked Lawrence and Freddy assume roles in her scheme and, after sending her guests off to refresh themselves, takes the pair aside and announces that while she made three million dollars the previous year, "[their] fifty thousand was the most fun". Joining arms, they set out to fleece their latest victims.

Hyun Jae, or Jae for short, is an 18-year-old Korean-American girl living in New Mexico in 1994 with her immigrant parents. Jae goes out one night with a friend and hits it off with a young fireman at a bar, who offers to give her a ride home at the end of the night. Jae eventually notices his fireman badge is fake and attempts to escape his car, but she is captured, bound and transported in the trunk of another car.
Jae is taken to an isolated warehouse, where she is drugged, has her braces removed, personal belongings taken away, is fitted with a tracking bracelet and put into an area of the warehouse called the stables. Jae is introduced to Bob, a corrupt law enforcement official who was earlier shown killing two people in cold blood and who is the local leader of a sex trafficking ring, as well as his volatile, drug-addicted overseer, Vaughn. Bob informs Jae that he has information about her parents and that they will be harmed if she doesn't cooperate. He renames her Eden and gives her two days to adapt to her new life before she is forced to work. Eden endures daily pregnancy tests, being forced to star in pornographic films and being prostituted out. During her first prostitution "job," Eden attacks the client and tries to escape once again, but Vaughn captures her and punishes her by forcing her to lie in a tub filled with ice overnight.
One year passes, and Eden has adapted as much as possible to life in the operation and has befriended another girl named Priscilla, who is shocked to learn Eden is as old as she is (by now, 19). Priscilla tells Eden something unknown happens to girls who become "too old." Moments later, Priscilla herself is mysteriously taken away. Eden notices that Vaughn's trustee, a girl named Svetlana, has obtained the class ring she was given by her father the day of her abduction and makes an attempt to forcibly retrieve it from her until Vaughn and an enforcer pull her off. Vaughn forces Eden to swallow the ring, which she does, but Eden then volunteers to assist Vaughn in overseeing the operation, specifically with accounting. After working one night at a college fraternity party, Vaughn has Eden assist him in accounting from the frat brothers, and in recapturing two other girls who attempt to escape. Eden begins replacing Svetlana as Vaughn's trustee, answering phones and assisting with day-to-day operations, and is taken out of the sex work side of the operation.
Bob is shown leading a seminar on drug trafficking, but is questioned by detectives as he was placed by a GPS at the location of a missing deputy and landowner, the two people he killed earlier in the movie. Eden and Vaughn meet Bob later to dispose of bodies in the nearby lake, including Svetlana. Vaughn suddenly and brutally kills Bob on the boat, presumably because of his implication in the death of the deputy and landowner.
One day, while answering phones, Eden is taking a customer's order when the customer asks how much it'll cost, which Eden knows is an indication that it is a police sting, but she takes the order anyway and says nothing. Eden and Vaughn take a girl to the house of a man named Mario, and Eden instantly recognizes him as the one who transported her to the warehouse in the trunk of his car. Eden goes to the bathroom and finds a room full of baby beds. She also finds Priscilla, who is heavily pregnant (why she was taken away, as she'd tested positive on one of the daily tests) and blissfully ignorant as to what will actually happen to her baby (he or she will be sold). Vaughn notices Eden being withdrawn on the way back, deduces that she found out what Mario's house is used for and attempts to force Eden to kill a girl in the desert to prove her loyalty, but she is stopped at the last minute by Vaughn.
Vaughn is informed that one of his enforcers have flipped on the operation, presumably because of Eden sending him to a sting. Eden is forced to start packing the girls for the move and is taken to Vaughn's house, where Vaughn informs her they are moving to Dubai. Eden realizes this could be her last chance to escape. While he is in the bathroom, she sprays Vaughn's meth pipe with chemicals that Vaughn inhales, killing him. Eden then cuts the tracking bracelet off her ankle, takes drugs and money from Vaughn's house, and goes to Mario's house. Eden attempts to negotiate Priscilla's freedom; Mario refuses but admits that he remembers Eden. He agrees to let her see Priscilla. While his back is turned, Eden injects Mario with drugs and kills him. Eden finds Priscilla, telling her her baby was sold, and they both escape the house. Eden finds a pay phone and calls her mother, hearing her voice for the first time in a year.
In the near future, Detroit, Michigan, is a dystopia on the verge of total collapse due to financial ruin and a high crime rate. The mayor signs a deal with the mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP), giving it complete control of the underfunded Detroit Police Department. In exchange, OCP will be allowed to turn the run-down sections of Detroit into a high-end utopia called Delta City. OCP's new CEO Dick Jones proposes assisting the police with the ED-209 law enforcement droid. At its first demonstration, however, ED-209 malfunctions and gruesomely kills an executive. Bob Morton, an ambitious junior executive, uses the opportunity to introduce his own experimental cyborg design, "RoboCop". To Jones's anger, the company chairman (referred to as the Old Man) approves Morton's plan.
OCP ostensibly reassigns officers into crime-ridden districts in anticipation that someone will be killed in action for use as a test subject for RoboCop. Alex Murphy is newly-partnered to Anne Lewis; on their first patrol, they chase a gang of criminals, led by Clarence Boddicker. Boddicker's gang hides in an abandoned steel mill and Murphy and Lewis separate on foot to find them. While Murphy manages to kill two of them, he is caught by Boddicker and the others; the gang tortures Murphy, brutally gunning him down before Boddicker personally executes him. He is declared dead and OCP selects him as the RoboCop candidate; they replace most of his body with cybernetics, leaving his human brain. RoboCop is programmed with three directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law; RoboCop, Morton, and his team are unaware of a classified fourth directive.
RoboCop, assigned to Murphy's former district, proceeds to efficiently rid the streets of crime. Meanwhile the deteriorating situation in Detroit lead by the mismanagement of OCP leads the human officers to threaten to strike. Lewis believes RoboCop is Murphy based on his exhibiting some of Murphy's behaviors. As RoboCop suffers from latent memories from Murphy, he discovers his true identity and that his wife and son moved away after Murphy's death. Jones, fearing he will be displaced by the newly-promoted Morton, discreetly hires Boddicker to murder Morton.
During a hold-up at a gas station, RoboCop recognizes the robber as one of Boddicker's gang, triggering memories of Murphy's execution. RoboCop reviews police records, identifies the other gang members including Boddicker, and confronts them. During Boddicker's arrest, he admits to being hired by Jones. With this evidence recorded on video, RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones at OCP; Jones openly admits his role in Morton's death before revealing what the fourth directive is: it prevents RoboCop from arresting any OCP executive officer or staff member. With RoboCop's programming limiting his abilities, Jones sends the ED-209 (which has been stationed in his office) to attack RoboCop, severely damaging him. Jones also asks police to meet them at the tower. Lewis, who had been following RoboCop, helps him escape to safety of the same steel mill and undergo repairs.
The police follow through with their strike, creating chaos in the city. Boddicker and his gang are released from prison and acquire new high-powered rifles to finish off RoboCop. Boddicker, using a tracking system provided to him by Jones, heads towards the steel mill. RoboCop and Lewis work together to eliminate the gang, though Lewis is injured. RoboCop heads to OCP HQ alone and uses one of the rifles to destroy the ED-209 guarding the entrance. He barges in on an executive meeting where the Old Man and Jones are present and shows them the video of Jones' confession. Jones takes the Old Man as a hostage, knowing that the fourth directive still protects him. The Old Man promptly fires Jones, nullifying the protection and allowing RoboCop to shoot Jones, who falls out of a window to his death. Grateful, the Old Man commends RoboCop's shooting and asks what his name is; RoboCop smiles and answers, "Murphy", indicating his humanity is restored.
In 1927, Captain Lilly (Harry Beresford) is a steamboat captain who pilots a boat on the Mississippi River, with the help of his son, States (Lew Ayres). Along their route is a shantytown made up of houseboats, the residents of which often fight with the steamboat crowd.
After a shooting match between States and shanty-boater Chicken Sam (John Carradine), Sam reveals to States his true heritage: Captain Lilly killed States' real father - a shanty-boater - and adopted States as his own son. States confirms this fact with court records, and after leaving Captain Lilly, becomes a boarder on Aunt Vergie's (Elizabeth Patterson) houseboat. Vergie's daughter Towhead (Anita Louise), falls in love with States and, understanding that he's homesick, sneaks onto Captain Lilly's steamboat and takes his dog, Shoo-Fly. States tries to get the dog to return to Captain Lilly, but Shoo-Fly insists on staying by his side. Later when Captain Lilly approaches States to ask him to come back, he sees Shoo-Fly and - believing that States kidnapped the dog - denounces him.
States then builds his own shanty-boat with a breakwater protecting it, only to have Captain Lilly drive his own steamboat into it, thinking it is creating a bar in the river. Unknown to Captain Lilly, Towhead, was in States' boat at the time, and she is injured during the crash.
States also plans to marry Towhead, but Captain Lilly has him institutionalized in a reform school when he hears of his plans. States is later freed from the institution by some of his friends and then borrows a gun with the intention of going after Captain Lilly and killing him.
In the meantime, the Mississippi River has begun to flood dangerously, and people from the nearby town have been trying to burn down the shantytown, prompting the shanty-boaters to release their boats from their moorings. States dives into the river, swimming for Aunt Vergie's boat. Captain Lilly follows with his steamboat, scanning the river with a searchlight. States finds Vergie and Towhead on their shantyboat and stays with them, boarding up the windows.
Captain Lilly catches sight of Aunt Vergie's shantyboat headed for a break in a levee and, realizing that it will likely be destroyed, saves the boat just before it reaches the break. Lilly continues to help other shanty-boaters, his former rivals, and by morning, States is back in Captain Lilly's pilot house with Towhead by his side.

Sathya meets an old police man, Krishnamurthy, who got suspended for letting a terrorist slip away as a constable. It turns out that Gunasekaran accepted a bribe from the terrorist and let him go, but this has already ruined Murthys profession. Sathya talks to Murthy about life and how things have changed. After this, Murthy sees the man who sold him the gun and leaves. Murthy kills him with the same gun when he follows Murthy to a restroom. However we learn that Murthy is actually the leader of the robbery and he kills the officer who didn't sanction his Provident Fund. Sathya, now looking for clues in the murder, finds Murthy's application sanctioned and goes to his house to give it to him. However, Murthy's son tells him that the application got sanctioned earlier and Murthy gave the money to the family, by connecting the murder of the guy who sold the gun and Murthy's son's statement he figures out that Murthy is the robber and the boss. Meanwhile, Murthy follows Gunasekaran to a bank and attempts another robbery and kills him, after which he throws the money on the street. When Murthy returns home he finds out that the police have surrounded him. Pandian takes Murthy's grandson hostage and there is a confrontation in which Sathya walks out with his gun . He later tells the investigation board that Murthy shot Pandian dead and Sathya had killed Murthy in self-defense. Sathya is given his job back.
As Sathya drives with Meera, she tells him that he should not feel bad for Murthy, as he was a bad person. And we are shown what actually happens in that room. Pandian with his gun on Murthy's grandsons head slips, and a shot is fired. Murthy in shock, shoots and kills Pandian, but it turns out that Pandian missed and did not hit Murthy's grandson. Sathya grabs Murthy and fights him, but cannot hurt him as he feels sorry for him. Murthy stands up and grabs the gun and tells Sathya to shoot him. He then explains that he did not tell his family about his cancer because he heard the family speaking why god didn't take him instead of his wife. He then says he robbed the bank for them and that he wanted to live his last days as a king. Murthy also says he did not mean to shoot the child and breaks down. Murthy grabs Sathya's hands, puts the gun to his forehead and says he doesn't want to put the family in shame by going to prison then shoots himself dead with the last bullet when Sathya hesitates.
After this flashback, at a stop light, Sathya sees the employer that framed him, on the side of the street, and the movie ends.
The film begins with what a BBC reviewer called "perhaps one of cinema's most innovative opening sequences."[3] The scene is a long, behind-the-back tracking sequence featuring Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) walking through the hallway of a police station to report his own murder. Oddly, the police almost seem to have been expecting him and already know who he is.
A flashback begins with Bigelow in his hometown of Banning, California, where he is an accountant and notary public. He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.
Bigelow accompanies a group from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a "jive" nightclub called "The Fisherman," unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat subculture. The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor's office, where tests reveal he swallowed a "luminous toxin" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange.
With a few days to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula. She provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Phillips, who had been urgently trying to contact Bigelow for the last few days, had suddenly died. Bigelow travels to Phillips' import-export company in Los Angeles, first meeting Miss Foster (Beverly Garland) (whose on-screen credit reads "Beverly Campbell"), the secretary, and then Mr. Halliday (William Ching), the company's comptroller, who tells him Eugene Phillips committed suicide by jumping from his office a day earlier. From there, the trail leads to Phillips' widow (Lynn Baggett) and brother Stanley (Henry Hart).
The key to the mystery is a bill of sale for what turns out to be stolen iridium. Bigelow had notarized the document for Eugene Phillips six months earlier on behalf of Phillips' business associate George Reynolds. He connects Phillips' mistress, Marla Rakubian (Laurette Luez), to gangsters led by Majak (Luther Adler). They capture Bigelow where he learns that Reynolds was murdered months earlier after the sale. Since Bigelow has learned too much, Majak orders his psychopathic henchman Chester (Neville Brand) to kill him. However, Bigelow manages to escape and Chester is killed by the police while attempting to kill Bigelow.
Bigelow thinks Stanley and Miss Foster are his killers, but when he confronts them he finds Stanley has been poisoned too—after having dinner with Mrs. Phillips. He directs them to call an ambulance and tells them what poison has been ingested so that, in Stanley's case at least, prompt treatment may save his life. Stanley tells Bigelow he found evidence that Halliday and Mrs. Phillips were having an affair. Bigelow realizes that the theft was merely a diversion. Eugene discovered the affair and Halliday killed him.
Halliday and Mrs. Phillips used the investigation of the iridium as a cover for their crime, making it seem that Eugene Phillips had killed himself out of shame. However, when they discovered that there was evidence of his innocence in the notarized bill of sale, Halliday murdered anyone who had knowledge of the bill of sale. Bigelow tracks Halliday down and shoots him to death in an exchange of gunfire.
The flashback comes to an end. Bigelow finishes telling his story at the police station and dies, his last word being "Paula." The police detective taking down the report instructs that his file be marked "D.O.A."

Rahul's mother becomes increasingly concerned about his sexual orientation so he asks Janet to marry him. Shonali's drug abuse worsens and she attends a rehabilitation clinic. Meghna pays the price of her increasing fame by losing her close friends due to her changed attitude towards them. She becomes pregnant with Abhijit's child, and reluctantly has an abortion due to conditions in her contract. After realizing that she was deceived in her relationship, Meghna tells Abhijit's wife about their relationship, and Abhijit ends Meghna's contract with Panache. Upset at the turn of events, Meghna descends into alcoholism; at a rave party she uses cocaine and unwittingly has a one-night stand. When sober, she feels guilty and returns to her parents in Chandigarh.
Broken and depressed, Meghna lives in Chandigarh for over a year. Her father encourages her to return to Mumbai; Meghna rekindles her friendship with Janet and models for Rohit's show, where she freezes on the ramp after seeing the lights and cameras. She visits Maanav (now an established model) to apologize and learns that he is engaged. Shonali appears on television as a mentally ill, homeless alcoholic; Meghna takes her in and tries to rehabilitate her. Meghna accepts an offer from Rahul to model, but a day before the show Shonali vanishes. Just before Meghna walks the ramp, she receives a call from the police telling her that Shonali is dead from a drug overdose. Meghna freezes; overcoming her grief, she walks the ramp, reviving her career and restoring her self-confidence. Meghna gives up drinking and smoking, and as the film closes she walks the ramp in Paris.

Malli is fired from his job, his mother loses confidence in him. He finds out that Chandra, a fellow fisherman prepared Ganja. Chandra, after being beaten up by Malli, confesses that Sambasivayya has ordered him to do so as he felt that Sarala and Malli are in love. An enraged Malli goes to Sambasivayya’s home to settle the score but finds that he is not in town. Sarala challenges an inebriated Malli as he is walking away after threatening to outrage her modesty by saying, "You seem to have forgotten that you are a man after the beating you got from police due to my dad."
